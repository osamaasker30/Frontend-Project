                        Aleppo, according to the UNESCO Organization for Historical and Archaeological Research, is the oldest city in the world, dating back to 12,200 BC, preceding Jericho by 1,600 years and preceding Damascus by three thousand years. Several studies indicate that the city of Aleppo has been inhabited for tens of thousands of years, making it a reference for scholars from all over the world. Most sources indicate that the first builder of Aleppo was Balukush al-Mawsili, one of the kings of Assyria, and his reign was determined to be 3962 years for Adam Abu al-Bishr. The village of Tell Maribet was discovered near the Euphrates Valley in Aleppo, and it contains ruins dating back to the year 11,000 BC, making it the oldest known area in Syria.

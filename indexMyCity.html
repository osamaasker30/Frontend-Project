                    <p>
                        The Syrian city of Aleppo was the main focus of the Syrian conflict between the opposition fighters on the one hand, and the Syrian army supported by Russia and Iran on the other.
                            <br>
                        Many archaeologists agree that Old Aleppo is a museum that includes the most amazing buildings.
                            <br>
                        The mosques, temples, caravanserais, and adjacent and symmetrical markets are among the most prominent landmarks in the city.
                            <br>
                        The conflict in Syria caused destruction and looting of many of the heritage and archaeological treasures in Syria, which were described as an "open-air museum."

                        The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) mentioned in a report the extent of the damage in the archaeological sites of Aleppo, indicating that a third of the city was completely destroyed during the war years, and 60 percent of the old city was badly damaged, while 30 percent was completely destroyed.

                        The city of Aleppo has been affected in an unimaginable way in the field of education after it had the best university in the Arab countries. Schools were destroyed and thousands of students were deprived of completing their studies.
                        The situation is still the same as some children are trying to convince themselves that they are in a dream in order to escape from this painful reality
